* C-q prefix

| Key binding                      | Function            |
|----------------------------------+---------------------+
| C-q C-<letter-in-caret-notation> | (quoted-insert ARG) |
| C-q <octal-number> RET           | (quoted-insert ARG) |

The ~C-q~ prefix allows you to enter characters (ASCII control characters or otherwise) in a
convenient way.
- For example:
 - ~C-q C-<letter-in-caret-notation>~
   - ~C-q C-@~ inserts ~^@~ 
   - ~C-q C-A~ inserts ~^A~
 - ~C-q <octal-number> RET~
  - ~C-q 0 RET~ inserts ~^@~
  - ~C-q 1 RET~ inserts ~^A~

If you do not want to be entering octal numbers you can set ~read-quoted-char-radix~ to the
radix you would like to use:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq read-quoted-char-radix 8)  ; for octal
  (setq read-quoted-char-radix 10) ; for decimal
  (setq read-quoted-char-radix 16) ; for hexadecimal
#+END_SRC
